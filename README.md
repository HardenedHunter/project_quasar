A C# revival of the old idea.

For ~3 years (so, basically since I have started programming) I have had an idea of creating a deep (Collossal-Cave-Adventure-like)
text-based singleplayer game. And by deep I mean the one with some RPG elements attached to it, with decent plot and storytelling,
an ability to save your progress, etc. I haven't had time to properly work on it, plus it was written in Python 3, which means that
I would have needed to learn Python in addition to three other programming languages that I learn at the university. Python is still
one of my absolute favourite languages, but C# is much more robust in terms of building applications (even though I've said that I've been
making a text game, having a somewhat-solid UI to scroll through text and manage items is always great, so yeah, Windows Forms everyone).
Well, let's see how far I can push (pun intented) this one.
